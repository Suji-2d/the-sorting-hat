# The Sorting Hat

The Sorting Hat project involved creating a system where users answer a set of personality questions. Using machine learning techniques, the user is then sorted into one of the Hogwarts houses based on their personality traits. To gather personality scores, an improvised Big Five personality method was utilized.

To facilitate the project, a sample dataset consisting of 100,000 entries was developed based on the research (Zhi-Dan Zhao and Ming-Sheng Shang, 2010) the Hogwarts students personality and the house they belong to. This dataset served as a foundation for training the machine learning model.

The Naive Bayes Classification model was employed to accurately identify the house that best aligns with the user's personality. This model utilizes probabilistic algorithms to predict the house based on the inputted personality traits.

By leveraging machine learning and the Big Five personality approach, the Sorting Hat project aimed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users, replicating the sorting process seen in the renowned Harry Potter series.
